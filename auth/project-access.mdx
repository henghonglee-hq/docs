<Note>
  Before you can start using GnosisRamp, you need to **contact the GnosisRamp team** to create an organization for you. Once your organization is set up, you'll be able to login to the dashboard and create projects.

## Getting Your Credentials

Each project in the GnosisRamp dashboard provides a unique `clientId` and `clientSecret` pair. These credentials are displayed once when created, so store them securely in your secret manager.

## Using Your Credentials

Your project credentials are used to authenticate with the GnosisRamp API using HTTP Basic Authentication.

### Basic Authentication

Use your `clientId` as the username and `clientSecret` as the password for HTTP Basic Auth:

```bash
# Format: clientId:clientSecret encoded in base64
curl -X POST https://api.gnosisramp.io/v1/customers/token-exchange \
  -u "your_client_id:your_client_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "subject_token": "your_oidc_token"
      }'
```

Alternatively, you can manually construct the Authorization header:

```bash
# Base64 encode "clientId:clientSecret"
echo -n "your_client_id:your_client_secret" | base64

# Use the encoded value in the Authorization header
curl -X POST https://api.gnosisramp.io/v1/customers/token-exchange \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "subject_token": "your_oidc_token"
      }'
```

## Credential Security

- **Store securely**: Keep your client secret in a secure vault or environment variables. Never commit credentials to version control.
- **Rotate regularly**: Generate new credentials periodically and update your applications.
- **Separate environments**: Use different credentials for sandbox and production environments.

## Next Steps

Once you have your credentials, proceed to the [Token Exchange](/auth/token-exchange) guide to learn how to authenticate your customers and obtain GnosisRamp JWTs.
