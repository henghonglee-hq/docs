title: "Auto-complete for Returning Customers"
description: "Skip onboarding when every compliance requirement already passes."

When a customer has already satisfied every plugin requirement, GnosisRamp auto-completes the intent and immediately creates a transaction. This avoids sending repeat customers back through onboarding and dramatically reduces time-to-deposit.

## Response shape

Regardless of the path, the response from `POST /intent` always includes:

```json
{
  "intent": { ... },
  "frontendUrl": "https://app.gnosisramp.com/intent/int_123" | null,
  "workflowId": "wf_abc" | null,
  "transaction": { ... } | null
}
```

- **New customers** – `frontendUrl` + `workflowId` populated, `transaction=null`.
- **Returning customers** – `frontendUrl=null`, `workflowId=null`, `transaction` contains deposit instructions.

## How GnosisRamp decides

1. After collecting requirements it calls every plugin’s `checkRequirements` hook.
2. If none throw errors, the compliance plan is marked `COMPLETED` and onboarding is skipped.
3. `executeTransaction` runs synchronously, generating deposit instructions immediately.

## Client logic

```ts
const response = await createIntent(payload);
if (response.transaction) {
  showDepositInstructions(response.transaction.context);
} else {
  redirectTo(response.frontendUrl);
}
```

## Safeguards

- Each intent can own only **one** transaction. If you manually call `POST /intent/:intentId/transaction` after auto-complete, you will receive `400 Bad Request` with `"Transaction already exists for this intent."`
- Auto-complete still enforces amount validation, provider capability checks, and dependency graphs — it simply recognises that all checks are already complete.
- If a plugin raises an error in `checkRequirements`, GnosisRamp falls back to the onboarding workflow silently.

Use auto-complete to give high-value customers a “just send funds” experience once their KYC/KYB portfolio is in good standing.
