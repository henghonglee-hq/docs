An **intent** describes the money you want to move between two external accounts. GnosisRamp handles provider selection, compliance orchestration, and workflow execution for you.

## 1. Create an intent

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.gnosisramp.io/v1/intent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GNOSISRAMP_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "customerId": "cust_9a8c",
        "srcExternalAccountId": "ext_src",
        "destExternalAccountId": "ext_dest",
        "amount": "100.25",
        "currencyCode": "USD",
        "redirectUrl": "https://app.yourdomain.com/success"
      }'
```

The platform will:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the optimal provider">
    GnosisRamp evaluates all available providers and selects the best match based on the source and destination accounts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create compliance plan">
    A compliance plan is created with all required steps for the transaction. The response includes a `frontendUrl` where you can direct users to complete any required onboarding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute compliance workflow">
    The compliance workflow runs through all required steps. Once the plan reaches `COMPLETED` status, you can proceed with the transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Poll or retrieve the intent

Use `GET /intent/{id}` to check which compliance requirements remain, monitor intent status, or confirm that auto-complete succeeded.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GNOSISRAMP_TOKEN" \
  https://api.gnosisramp.io/v1/intent/int_123
```

The response includes:

- `intent.status` – Current status: `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, etc.
- `compliancePlan.steps` – Ordered list of compliance requirements with their current status.
- `transaction` – Transaction details when available (auto-complete or after calling the transaction endpoint).

## 3. Error signals

| Scenario | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| No providers can handle the route | `POST /intent` returns `400` with `"No provider can handle the requested external accounts"`. You may need to enable additional providers for your project. |
| Amount precision mismatch | `AmountValidationError` with details about allowed decimals (fiat, stablecoin, native tokens, BTC). Adjust the decimal string before retrying. |
| Requirements failure | The intent is marked as `FAILED` and the failure reason is available in `compliancePlan.steps[].metadata`. |

Once onboarding passes you can either rely on auto-complete (covered next) or call the transaction API to fetch deposit instructions.
